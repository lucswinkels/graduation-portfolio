# Graduation internship portfolio

This is my portfolio for my graduation internship @ Moonly Software during my IT & Media Design study at the Fontys University of Applied Science, where I worked on developing a new B2C e-commerce platform.

This portfolio was built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

Content is maintained using [Sanity CMS](https://www.sanity.io/).

A live demo is available [here](https://graduation.lucswinkels.com).
